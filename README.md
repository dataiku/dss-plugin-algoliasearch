# Algoliasearch Plugin

This Dataiku DSS plugin provides a read/write connector to interact with [Algolia Search](https://www.algolia.com).

With this plugin, you can:

* Import a complete Algolia index as a [DSS](https://www.dataiku.com/dss) dataset
* Copy a DSS dataset to an Algolia index

You could thus use a DSS [Flow](http://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/flow/index.html) to prepare your
Algolia search index.

# Changelog

## Version 0.0.9 (2020/09/07)
* Handling pagination

## Version 0.0.6 (2019/04/30)
* Add a code environment

## Version 0.0.5 (2018/06/05)

Thanks to @raphi for this contribution!

* Made the object size limit since it's not the same limit for all users (and it's better to let it handled/reject by the Algolia API itself)
* Fixed the boolean type not being recognized as it by Algolia
* Allowed custom batch size for indexing operations with a default to 10k objects, which drastically improves the processing/indexing time

## Version 0.0.4 (2016/06/28)

* Truncate to 8K chars instead of 5K
* Minor wording fixes

# Improvement ideas

* Add ability to put a query to restrict what is being fetched

* Add another connector to fetch the Algolia query logs
* Add another connector to retrieve the 0-results queries from Algolia analytics API
